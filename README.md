 The **isometricObelisk** module allows you to create basic isometric
 (2.5D) shapes such as cube, pyramid, bricks, and more for you html
 canvas project.
 
**Cool projects created with `isometricObelisk.js` module**

## Acknowledgements

This module is based on [Obelisk.js](https://github.com/nosir/obelisk.js),  written by Max Huag ([@nosir](https://github.com/nosir/)) and [contributed by github community](https://github.com/nosir/obelisk.js/graphs/contributors). This library was further improved by me ([@GeorgeGks](https://github.com/GeorgeGks)) with the development of this add-on module. I also want to thank all the users and my teachers who reviewed that Wiki Page and Logo Image.

##Documentation Support

I did my best to create a detailed documentation on how to use this module. Please go to [Wiki Page](https://github.com/GeorgeGks/isometricObelisk.js/wiki) of this project to find how to move in this module, what each parameters mean, and to view illustated tutorials with basic and advance usage.

After you read it, this is how simple is to create a basic cube isometric shape using the default values:

```javascript
_isometric.cube().color().position().render();
```
